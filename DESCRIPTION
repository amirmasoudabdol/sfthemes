Description: sfthemes is a collection of ggplot2 themes, scales, and colors inspired by
             Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, and based on occasional appearances of charts used by
             Apple within different contexts, e.g., Apple Health app, Screen Time on iOS and macOS.
             In terms of typography, we optimized our themes to be compatible with SF Pro.
             Additionally, we adhere to HIG’s dynamic type sizes in order to provide consistent
             and elegant overall rescaling.
