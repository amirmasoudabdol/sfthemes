Author: Amir Masoud Abdol
Maintainer: Amir Masoud Abdol <amirmasoudabdol@icloud.com>
Description: Collection of color scales inspired by default system colors in Apple's platforms, 
    and [visual design guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/).
    As well as a dark and light theme inspired and interpolated by/from occasional use of charts in Apple's platforms, i.e.,
    Apple Health, Screen Time. 
    Design of the sfthemes package itself is heavily based on the excellent [hrbrthemes](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes) package.
