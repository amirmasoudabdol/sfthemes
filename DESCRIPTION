Description: This is a collection of ggplot2 themes,
    scales, and colors inspired by Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, and
    based on occasional appearances of charts used by Apple within
    different contexts, e.g., Apple Health app, Screen Time on iOS and
    macOS.  In terms of typography, we optimized our themes to be
    compatible with SF Pro.  Additionally, we adhere to HIG’s dynamic type
    sizes in order to provide consistent and elegant overall
    rescaling.
