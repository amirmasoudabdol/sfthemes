Description: This is a pair of light and dark ggplot2 themes,
    and a collection of color scales based on iOS, macOS and watchOS
    system colors. Themes are inspired by the occasional appearances of
    charts used by Apple within different contexts, e.g., Apple Health
    app, Screen Time on iOS and macOS. And colors are adapted from iOS,
    macOS, and watchOS system colors. Each color scale has a light and
    dark variant as well that compliments the light/dark themes,
    `scale_colour_ios_light()` and `scale_colour_ios_dark()` respectively.
