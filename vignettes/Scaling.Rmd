Besides dynamic type sizing, sfthemes can also scale all other elements of the plot. This is being done by multiplying all element sizes with a specific multiplier. Keep in mind that these values will scale the existing sizes of each elements; therefore, it is recommended that you do not try to scale your entire plot if you are using `size` or `lwd` as one of your `aes`.
