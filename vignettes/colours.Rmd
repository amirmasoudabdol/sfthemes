[Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) provides two primary color palettes for each platform, light and dark. 

On iOS, each palette is accompanied by an accessible variant where the temperature and transparency of colors are adjusted to provide higher contrast and brightness. Both light and dark palettes can be used with `theme_sf_light()` and `theme_sf_dark()` themes. However, we recommend using light palettes with light themes, and dark palettes with dark themes.

On macOS, in addition to light and dark palettes and their accessible forms, each palette is accompanied with a **vibrant** variant where the contrast between colors is even higher.

On watchOS, only one color palette is provided. The watchOS color palette is specifically designed to provide higher level of contrast and brightness, and it is best accompanied by dark themes.

## Color’s Order

Each palette in sfthemes can be sorted in two ways. The *`default`* order returns colors of the palette according to their appearance in Apple’s HIG document, and the *`contrast`* (default) order returns an optimized ordering of colors to maximize their in-between contrast.
