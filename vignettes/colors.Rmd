## Color Palettes

SFThemes provides three categories of colors, iOS, macOS and watchOS. Both iOS and macOS offers two families of palettes, light and dark. Each palette offers an accessible set of colors that are color-blind optimized and have lower contrast. Additionally, macOS offers *Vibrant* sets of colors with their own set of accessible variants.
