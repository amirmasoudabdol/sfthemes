## Typography

### San Francisco Family

[San Francisco typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(sans-serif_typeface)) consists of three large family of typefaces, SF Pro, SF Compact, and SF Mono. They are degined to be used in different Apple platforms, e.g., iOS, macOS. Each family has its own characteristic and is optimized for certain screensize and resolution. sfthemes is optimized for SF Pro, the most general variant of the typeface designed for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. 

Apple restricted the usage of the entire SF typeface family for developers who ar designing and developing applications for Apple's platforms. Please keep this resctriction in mind when using and sharing your plots, if you are using SF Pro as the main typeface of the plots.

Moreover, distirbution and repackaging of San Francisco family is prohibited, however, the fonts can be downloaded directly from Apple's website. [Download SF Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)

### Inter, The Alternative

As an alternative, sfthemes uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) family. Inter typeface is a [free and open source](https://github.com/rsms/inter), and you are free to use it in almost any way imaginable. 

Inter is closely related to SF Pro. Like SF Pro, it is crafted and designed for computer screens, therefore sfthemes plots with Inter fonts will look a lot like their SF Pro variants.
