### About Fonts

#### On Apple's SF Family

You can download the mentioned fonts from [Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for free, but be aware of 
their commercial license. You can find the license after installing the font in your font previewer app. On macOS, 
you can navigate to Font Book/Preview/Show Font Info for more information.

#### Inter, The Alternative

[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) has a close resemblance with Apple's San Francisco fonts. It's similarly designed for use in
user interface, and it's freely available.
