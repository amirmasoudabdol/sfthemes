# sfthemes
A colection of `ggplot2` themes, scales and colors inspired by [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/).

---

sfthemes is a collection of `ggplot2` themes, scales, and colors inspired by [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/), and based on occasional
appearance of charts used by Apple within different contexts, and platforms, e.g., Apple Health app, Screen Time on iOS and macOS. In terms of typography, we optimized our themes to be compatible with [SF Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/), and adhere to HIG's [dynamic type sizes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/).
