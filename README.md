# sfthemes
Collection of `ggplot2` colors scales, and themes inspired by Apple's system colors.

---

sfthemes is a collection of `ggplot2` color scales, and themes inspired by Apple's system colors, and occasional
appearance of charts in Apple's platforms, i.e., Apple Health, Screen Time. When it comes to the typography of themes, 
Inter is the default font of the package. This is due to a commercial license of the Apple family of fonts; however, if 
you are using your plots in the context of Apple's disclosed license you can use either of their fonts, i.e., San 
Francisco, San Francisco Mono, and New York. Both themes are optimized to work smoothly despite your choice.

### About Fonts

#### On Apple's SF Family

You can download the mentioned fonts from [Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for free, but be aware of 
their commercial license. You can find the license after installing the font in your font previewer app. On macOS, 
you can navigate to Font Book/Preview/Show Font Info for more information.

#### Inter, The Alternative

[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) has a close resemblance with Apple's San Francisco fonts. It's similarly designed for use in
user interface, and it's freely available.
