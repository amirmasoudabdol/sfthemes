sfthemes is a pair of [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) themes, `theme_sf_light()`, `theme_sf_dark()`, and a collection of color scales based on [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/). Themes are inspired by the occasional appearances of charts used by Apple within different contexts, e.g., Apple Health app, Screen Time on iOS and macOS. And colors are adapted from iOS, macOS, and watchOS system colors. Each color scale has a light and dark variant as well that compliments the light/dark themes, `scale_colour_ios_light()` and `scale_colour_ios_dark()` respectively. 

When bond together, sfthemes offers a unique opportunity to generate two version of your plot, i.e., light/dark, with two *similar* but *individually* optimized color scales for each variant of your plot.

    <img src="man/figures/front-page-main-alt.png" class = "img-responsive center-block d-block mx-auto"/>

In addition, sfthemes uses [dynamic type sizing](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/) in order to provide a consistent and elegant overall resizing and re-scaling of plot elements. **Read more [here](articles/typography.html).**

## Install

Install the development version from GitHub
```R
install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("amirmasoudabdol/sfthemes")
```

Install from CRAN [Not available yet!]
```R
install.packages("sfthemes")
```

## Preparation / Usage

You can load and configure sfthemes using the following commands. If you do not get any errors or warnings, sfthemes is fully configured and can access the required fonts.

```R
library(ggplot2); library(sfthemes)

# You only need to run these commands once!
import_inter()
```

### Quick Start

sfthemes offers two base themes, `theme_sf_light()` and `theme_sf_dark()`. The Light theme uses an off-white background, `#fafafa`, and a range of black colors for text. In contrast, the dark theme uses an off-black background, `#141414`, and a range of white colors for text. In addition to themes, sfthemes provides a set of `scale_colour/fill_*` objects based on various available color palettes in Apple's HIG. Each color palette has a light and a dark variant, as well as accessible form of those. Accessible color palettes are adjusted to have higher contrast and less brightness. List of all available color palettes can be found [here](reference/index.html#section-palettes).

#### Light and Dark Themes

In general, we recommend pairing light scales with `theme_sf_light` and dark scales with `theme_sf_dark` theme. Here we use `scale_colour_ios_light()`, and `scale_colour_ios_dark()` to recreate the figure above.

```R
# TODO: Update the code when the plot is finalized
```

#### Accessible Colors

Each color palette is accompanied with an accessible variant of itself. In order to access the accessible color palettes, we use `accessible` as follow:

```R
# TODO: Update the code when the plot is finalized
```

> The [Colors](articles/colours.html) article elaborates on the availability, differences, and features of each system color palette.

#### Scaling

sfthemes provides 7 scaling factor. Scaling factors can be applied to text, elements, or both. Figure below is generated from combination of light/dark plots in all available scaling factors. *Notice that that all elements are resizing at the same time.*

```R
# TODO: Update the code when the plot is finalized
```
