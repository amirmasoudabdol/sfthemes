# sfthemes
A colection of `ggplot2` scales, and themes inspired by Apple's system colors.

---

sfthemes is a collection of `ggplot2` color and fill scales, and themes inspired by Apple's system colors, and occasional
appearance of charts in Apple's platforms, i.e., Apple Health, Screen Time. When it comes to the typography of themes, 
Inter is the default font of the package. This is due to a commercial license of the Apple's family of fonts; however, if you are using your plots in the context of Apple's disclosed license you can use either of their fonts, i.e., San Francisco, San Francisco Mono, and New York. Both themes are optimized to work smoothly despite your choice.

### About Fonts

#### On Apple's SF Family

You can download the mentioned fonts from [Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for free, but be aware of 
their commercial license. You can find the license after installing the font in your font previewer app. On macOS, 
you can navigate to Font Book/Preview/Show Font Info for more information.

#### Inter, The Alternative

[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) has a close resemblance with Apple's San Francisco fonts. It's similarly designed for use in
user interface, and it's freely available.

## Color Scales

Apple's system colors are distinguised by the OS that they’ve been designed for, while some systems sharing the same color palette. SFThemes provides three categories of colors, iOS, macOS and watchOS. Both iOS and macOS offers two families of palettes, light and dark, in addition, each offers an accessible set of colors.
